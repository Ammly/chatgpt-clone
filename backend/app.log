Received message: when was the moon born?
Response message: The prevailing theory is that the moon was formed about 4.5 billion years ago, shortly after the formation of the solar system. This theory suggests that a Mars-sized object collided with the early Earth, and the resulting debris eventually coalesced to form the moon.
